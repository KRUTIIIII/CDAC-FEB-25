Snippet 18:  
public class Main { 
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        int a = 10; 
        int b = 5; 
        int result = a + b * 2; 
        System.out.println(result); 
    } 
} 
ï‚· What is the output of this code? How does operator precedence affect the result?

-------------------------------------------
There are no syntax errors in this code.
While there are no errors, operator precedence affects the result. In Java, the multiplication (*) operator has a higher precedence than addition (+). 
This means that b * 2 is evaluated first, and then the result is added to a.

b * 2 is calculated first: 5 * 2 = 10
Then, a + 10 is computed: 10 + 10 = 20
Output: 20
---------------------------
if we put brackets in betwn the output will chnge.
(a + b) * 2):
(10 + 5) * 2 = 15 * 2 = 30
Output: 30
