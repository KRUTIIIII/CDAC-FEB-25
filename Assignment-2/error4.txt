public class Main { 
    public static void main() { 
        System.out.println("Hello, World!"); 
    } 
} 
 What happens when you compile and run this code? Why is String[] args needed?

Error: Main method not found in class Main

explaination:In the above code,the String[] args parameter is missing.To fix the error, we need to change the main method signature to include String[] args, which is essential for the JVM to identify and execute the method as the starting point of the program.


corrected code:
public class Main { 
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        System.out.println("Hello, World!"); 
    } 
}
