ï‚· What runtime exception is thrown? Why does division by zero cause an issue in Java?
------------------------------------------------
The code gives a runtime error due to division by zero (a / b).
In Java, dividing an integer by zero is not allowed and results in an exception.
Java does not allow integer division by zero because it cannot produce a finite, well-defined result.
The JVM throws an ArithmeticException to prevent undefined behavior.
