public class Main { 
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        System.out.println("Hello, World!" 
    } 
} 
 What syntax errors are present? How do they affect compilation?


the code has a Syntac error in the SOP statement. There is a missing closing bracket in the sop statement. The missing ) causes the compiler to fail because it expects the statement to be complete, so the compiler does not understand where the statement ends.

corrected code:

public class Main { 
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        System.out.println("Hello, World!"); 
} 



syntax affects compilation:
-Syntax errors stop the program from compiling means it won't run until the error is fixed.
-the missing statements make the compiler unable to understand the code structure.
