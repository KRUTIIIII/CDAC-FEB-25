 What error occurs? Why can't reserved keywords be used as identifiers?
------------------------------------

error: 'class' is a keyword, and may not be used as an identifier
        int class = 10; 
            ^

class is a reserved keyword in Java, used to define a class. Java does not allow using keywords (like class, int, if, else, etc.) as variable names because they have predefined meanings in the language.
Since class is already used to declare classes, using it as a variable name confuses the compiler.
----------------------------------------------------------
public class Main { 
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        int myClass = 10;  
        System.out.println(myClass); 
    } 
} 
--------------------------------------------------
-Java reserves certain words called keywords for specific functions in the language.
-If we used class as a variable, the compiler wouldnâ€™t know whether it refers to a class declaration or a variable.
