public class Main { 
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        int x = y + 10; 
        System.out.println(x); 
    } 
} 
 What error occurs? Why must variables be declared?
 

 error: cannot find symbolE
        int x = y + 10; 
                ^
  symbol:   variable y
  location: class Main

-this error occurs because y has not been declared before it is used.

Corrected Code:
public class Main { 
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        int y = 5;  
        int x = y + 10; 
        System.out.println(x); 
    } 
} 

Variables must be declared before they are used. Declaring a variable tells Java how much memory to allocate. Declarations make code easier to understand.
