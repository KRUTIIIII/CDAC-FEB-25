Q.3. What error do you get when running this code? 
ans:
Modified code:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}



1. Error in the code:
The error occurs because the method main is declared as public void main(String[] args), but it should be public static void main(String[] args).


3.Explation: The main method must be static because it is called by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) .
void: The main method must return void as it doesn't return any value.
main: This is the entry point for Java applications.
String[] args: This parameter allows command-line arguments to be passed to the program.
In the given code, the main method is missing the static keyword, which is why the JVM will not be able to locate it as the entry point of the program.
